# Multi-FED-FCD
Implementation of the Finite-Excitation-Difference (FED), Finite-Charge-Difference (FCD) and the Multi-FED-FCD Scheme using the Open-Source Quantum-Chemistry Framework PySCF

## This is a work-in-progress project!

The FED-Scheme is built using the Hsu J. Phys. Chem. 2008 paper.

The FCD-Scheme is built using the Voityuk J. Phys. Chem 2002 paper.

The Multi-FED-FCD-Scheme is built using the Mennucci Photosynth. Res. 2018 paper.
